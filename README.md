<h1 align="center"> SHADOW </h1>
SHADOW is a full double encryption which means that it can encrypt/decrypt a specific file, a specific folder or an entire folder and thus all of its sub folders. The program is based on AES-256, Serpent-256 and SHA-256 and uses GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) as an operation mode for encryption.

<h3 align="left"> PASSWORD RULES </h3>
<h4 align="left"> For encryption, the user needs to confirm the password. (enter it twice)</h4>

	1) Password must be at least 12 Characters long (At least 12 characters).
	2) Password must contains at least ONE Upper character.
	3) Password must contains at least ONE Lower character.
	4) Password must contains at least ONE Digit.
	5) Password must contains at least ONE Special Character.

<h4 align="left"> WARNING FOR DECRYPTION!!! </h4>
This program comes with a security measure, which means that if the user enters the wrong password, the data contains in the files/folders will be erased. (See output example below).
